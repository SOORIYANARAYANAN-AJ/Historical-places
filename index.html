      <h1>Taj mahal</h1>
      <p>The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace') is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river
        Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658)
        to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb
        is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in
        formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p><a

      <h1>Red fort</h1>
      <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of
        the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he
        decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect
        Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture
        under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
